### Project Plan: "Past Present Future Spread" Web App

#### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a simple, pixel-styled web application for drawing tarot cards using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app will display three randomly drawn tarot cards labeled "Past", "Present", and "Future" with descriptions for each.

### Main Tasks

#### **Task 1: HTML Structure**
1. **Objective**: Create the basic structure of the app.
2. **Deliverable**: 
   - HTML file (`index.html`) with:
     - Title: "Past Present Future Spread".
     - Three card containers labeled "Past", "Present", and "Future".
     - Footer with a link to "Visit Pixel Oracle".
3. **Technical Considerations**:
   - Use semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`).
   - Ensure responsiveness with `<meta>` viewport tag.

#### **Task 2: CSS Styling**
1. **Objective**: Design the app with a pixelated aesthetic.
2. **Deliverable**: 
   - CSS file (`styles.css`) with:
     - Pixel font for all text.
     - Styling for the title, card layout, and footer.
3. **Technical Considerations**:
   - Use a pixel font (e.g., via `@font-face` or system monospace font).
   - Ensure cards are evenly spaced and visually distinct.
   - Add hover effects for interactivity.

#### **Task 3: JavaScript Logic**
1. **Objective**: Implement logic to draw and display random tarot cards.
2. **Deliverable**: 
   - JavaScript file (`script.js`) with:
     - A dataset of tarot cards (name and description).
     - A function to randomly select a card.
     - A function to display the selected cards in the UI.
3. **Technical Considerations**:
   - Use `Math.random()` for randomization.
   - Dynamically update card descriptions using DOM manipulation.
   - Ensure the app works without errors.

### Technical Considerations

#### HTML:
- Use `<div>` elements for card containers.
- Embed the CSS file using `<link>` in the `<head>`.
- Include the JavaScript file at the end of the `<body>` for better performance.

#### CSS:
- Use `flexbox` for the card layout to ensure responsive design.
- Style the footer link to match the pixelated theme.
- Test the app on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

#### JavaScript:
- Keep the dataset of tarot cards in an array for easy access.
- Use `querySelector` or `getElementById` to update card content.
- Ensure the app resets or redraws cards if needed (e.g., on page refresh).

### Timeline

#### **Day 1**: 
- Task 1: Complete HTML structure.

#### **Day 2**: 
- Task 2: Implement CSS styling.

#### **Day 3**: 
- Task 3: Write JavaScript logic.

#### **Day 4**: 
- Testing and Debugging:
  - Test responsiveness across devices.
  - Debug any issues with card drawing or display.

#### **Day 5**: 
- Final Review:
  - Ensure all requirements are met (pixel font, layout, functionality).
  - Optimize code for performance and readability.

### Deliverables
1. `index.html`: The main HTML file for the app.
2. `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the app.
3. `script.js`: The JavaScript file for card-drawing logic.

---

### Notes
- Ensure the app adheres to the constraints (no external libraries or frameworks).
- Focus on simplicity and pixelated design for a cohesive user experience.
- Test thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected.
